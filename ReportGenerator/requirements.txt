Loads the docx
	Read All Comments
	Read All Tokens
	Parse Comments	
	Parse Tokens	
Loop


1. Read all comments, Tokens
	The application reads a docx file and then it reads all the comments and all the tokens placed with in
	This is nessesary because we will use them in order to parse them. Parsing is explained later.
	For now we just load them from a document.docx
	Notice that tokens have two types. One type is {somealias} or this {!somealias}

	{somealias} must be a name located withing the database->fields.txt file which is a json file. It is an alias that corresponds to 
	a current field of a table. 

	{!somealias} must also be decllared with in databe->fields.txt file but will be parsed and use as a table field within a table
